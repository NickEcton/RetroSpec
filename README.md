# RetroSpec

### Background and Overview 

RestroSpec is an audio visualizer inspired by the old-school and undeniably cool Windows Media Player.
+ The inspiration for this project is dervied from the exciting and powerful visualiations first seen in WMP, but now with an updated and fresh visual appeal utilizing new technologies to bring everyones favorite audio and sounds to life.
+ This project will allow users to upload any media file they wish and watch as the visualizer takes control.

### Funcionality and MVP features
+ Be able to read from a default audio file provided to demo the funcionality
+ Create abstract and exciting visualizations in tune with the frequency and tempo of the music
+ Allow for multiple color schemes and visualtion switches based on user preference
+ Allow users to upload their own audio files for audio visualization
+ Give the users the ability to make slight audio changes to files including voice modulation or tempo control

## Architecture and Technologies
  ### Web Audio API
  + An HTML5 API used to load, control, and manipulate audio files while interacting with the DOM.
  + This API will handle the bulk of the work when it comes to playing the audio files as well as deriving the visulations.
  ### JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas
  + Javscript and Canvas will be used to create the exciting and new visualtions on the html page in real time with the music.
  + These technologies have since grown in popularity after the creation of the Windows Media Player and are incredibly powerful at creating unique and colorful designs. These technologies will showcase how far audio visualtion potential has come since WMP.
